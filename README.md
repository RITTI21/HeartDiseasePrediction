# Heart Disease Prediction with Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease based on patient health data. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model comparison using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Cleaned and analyzed heart disease dataset

Trained 8 ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)

Evaluated models using 5-fold cross-validation

Visualized performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, AUC)

ðŸ“Š Results
All evaluation metrics were visualized using bar plots to provide a clear comparison of model performances. This helps identify the best-performing algorithm based on specific criteria like accuracy or AUC.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
The model performance varies significantly across algorithms.

ROC-AUC and F1-score provide better insight into model reliability than accuracy alone.

Visualization helps in selecting the right model for deployment or further optimization.

ðŸ“Š Outcome:
Logistic Regression and KNN showed high performance in detecting heart disease. The project helps identify the most suitable model for heart disease prediction.

ðŸš€ Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

Feature engineering or selection

Model deployment via Flask/Django API

Integration into a healthcare application or dashboard
